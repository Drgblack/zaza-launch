# Zaza-Website
A repo for the development of the Zaza Ecosystem Website

v0.0.1
-  Exact figma design. Purple background, single page long.
-  Single iframe added.
-  "Sign up" and "Join Waitlist" buttons added

v0.1.0
-  Orange/pink color focused (intially, it's a gradient that fades into purple).
-  More content, albeit unordered, haphazard and too little to flesh out the site.
-  Added button and card hover animations.
-  Made the UI responsive.
-  X-axis overflow issue. Cause currently unknown.
-  Added email capture form.
-  Added white bakcground footer. Some color change is definitely in mind, black didn't seem to suit the theme of the website.

v0.2.0
-  Implemented the parallax effect and a placeholder background image.
-  Switched to rounded card type sections for the layout. 95% opaque to show the parallax effect more.
-  Added a solid white background color to the header and footer to cover the background parallax effect image.
-  X-axis overflow issue fixed.

v0.2.3
-   Changed the section background colors from pink or purple to white.
-   Changed buttons from filled colour ones to no-fill, coloured border ones.
-   Changed the footer background to a darker colour.
-   Changed the colour of the current page on the nav-bar.
-   Added a bit of colour to some of the headings (experimental).

v0.2.4
-   Added a prototype Brevo email Sign Up form.

v0.2.7
-   Fixed the features page table.
-   Noticed renaming of classes and IDs required.
-   Added a more card style focus to the layout (not sure if it's ideal, but it sure is what's there as of now).

v0.3.0
-   Bug fixes. (Overflow and responsiveness related.)
-   Added faqs.html, contacts.html and about.html.
-   Made the buttons redirect to the contact page for now.

v0.3.1
-   Fixed the table responsiveness issue (Wrapped the table in a div, made the div a flex container, justified it's items).

v0.3.2
-   Designed the founder page.
-   The placeholder logo and added and avatar to the founder page.
-   Removed "placeholder video" iframe from the index file.

v0.4.0
-   Mainly improved the semantics of the code.
-   Page titles now reflect the page name. Not in a substitution by variable manner where the code fetches the name of the page or something, it's still a simple static website. End goal is to integrate something like this.
-   Added favicon to all pages.
-   Deleted redundant code like unnecessary styles and ids.
-   Added comments to group similar styles.
-   Moved iframe styling to css.
-   Grouped CSS selectors (more in the css comments... It's a whole tree).
