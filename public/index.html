    <section>
      <h1>Planning Made Simple <span class="primary-color">in 3 Steps</span></h1>
      <p class="a-bit-bolder">Every week, teachers spend 6+ hours building lesson plans from scratch. That's time they don't have.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Zaza changes that.</strong>

        "We're teachers who got tired of spending Sunday nights frantically planning lessons instead of relaxing with family. After years of using generic AI tools that didn't understand classroom realities, we decided to build something different.

         Zaza Teach isn't just another AI tool - it's designed around how teachers actually work, think, and plan. Every feature comes from real classroom experience and real teacher frustrations. We can't wait to put this in your hands."
